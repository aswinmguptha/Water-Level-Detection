# Water-Level-Detection

Overuse of water is one of the present day concerns which has not yet got any perfect solutions. Families tend to be unaware of the amount of water they are using per day or per month. Electric motors are usually found across most houses, with which we could detect the amount of water consumed in a month. But this does not notify a person about wastage or over usage of water.

So we propose a system that notifies the person with the amount of water he/she has consumed for a period of time. For eg: the notification can be the usage of water per day. This helps a person to become cautious about the amount of water he uses for a period of time.

This data could be displayed on a web application, in the form of a graph which plots amount of water against time. Further processing can also be done with the data. And this can be used to infer meaningful insights from the same.

The dashboard can provide further assistance so that each time when the water is used, the user becomes cautious about the wastage of water.
